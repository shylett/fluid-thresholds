### ✨ Overview  
*Fluid Thresholds* is a visual embodiment of a journey across place, purpose, and possibility. Each  
curve and color mirrors the layered path of growth—from rooted beginnings in the Pacific  
to global stages of innovation and care.

This painting is shaped by four living principles:

- **Fluid** – Moving through change with grace and strength.  
- **Thoughtful** – Guided by intention, inquiry, and reflection.  
- **Globally Aware** – Holding the world in mind, always.  
- **Always Becoming** – In motion, in evolution, in emergence.
